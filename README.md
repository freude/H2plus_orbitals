# H2plus_orbitals

The script H2BS.py generate a set of orbitals defined on the 3D mesh for H2+ molecular ion in with the internuclear distance 1.4 a.u. (equilibrium distance). The computations are based on expension of the orbitals in rapidly converging series with the expansion coefficients taken from [D. R. Bates, Kathleen Ledsham and A. L. Stewart, Wave functions of the hydrogen molecular ion, Philosophical Trans. of Royal Soc. Lond. A, 246, 215-240 (1953)].
